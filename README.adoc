Learn how to map Java Objects to database tables and perform CRUD operations using JPA

:eventapp-url: http://localhost:9080/eventmanager.jsf
:get-events-url: http://localhost:9080/events

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to map Java objects to database tables.
JPA is a standard for Object Relational Mapping and eliminates the burden of having to write
SQL code when performing database operations.

The application that you will be working with is the event manager, which provides services for 
creating, retrieving, updating and deleting event entities. The application uses an Embedded Derby 
database as a datastore for all the events.

You will use JPA annotations to define an entity class whose fields are persisted to the 
database. Every entity object is managed by an `EntityManager` that will be injected into our
Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). In this guide, you will learn how to use a container-managed 
`EntityManager` so you will not need to explicity begin, commit or rollback database transactions,
the EJB container will manage the transaction boundaries for you.

Point your browser to the {eventapp-url} URL. The event application
currently has no events stored in the database. Go ahead and click on the `Create Event` button 
located in the left navigation bar. After entering an event name, location and time, click on `Submit` 
to persist your event entity to the database. The event is now stored in the database and is visible 
in the list of current events.

Notice that if you stop the Open Liberty server:
```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

and then restart it:
```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

The events created are still displayed in the list of current events. The `Update` button located 
beside each event allows you to make modifications to the persisted entity and the `Delete` button 
allows you to remove entities from the database.

== Defining a JPA entity class

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

To store Java objects in a database, you must define a JPA entity class. A JPA entity is a Java 
object whose non-transient fields will be persisted to the database. Any Plain Old Java Object (POJO) 
class can be designated as a JPA entity. However, the class must be annotated with the `@Entity` 
annotation, must not be declared final and must have a public or protected non-argument constructor. 
JPA uses a database table for every entity and persisted instances will be represented as one row in 
the table.

Add JPA annotations to the `Event` class and all of its fields in the 
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/models/Event.java` file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/models/Event.java[tags=!copyright;]
----

Lets break down the new annotations:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| `@Entity` | Declares the class as an entity
| `@Table`  | Specifies details of the table such as name 
| `@NamedQuery` | Specfies a database query using a static name
| `@Id`       |   Primary key of the entity
| `@GeneratedValue`    | Specifies the generation strategy for the value of the primary key, 
                        `strategy = GenerationType.AUTO` indicates that the persistence provider 
                        will pick a strategy depending on the database used
| `@Column`    | Specifies that the field is mapped to a column in the database table, `name` is 
                 optional and indicates the name of the column in the table
|===

// =================================================================================================
// Configuring the `EntityManager`
// =================================================================================================

== Configuring the `EntityManager`

An `EntityManager` instance provides the functionality for performing operations on the database 
such as persisting, loading, updating and deleting entities. The configuration of the `EntityManager`
instance is defined by a persistence unit specified in the `persistence.xml` file.

Create the `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` file:

[source, Xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml[tags=**;]
----

The persistence unit is defined by the `<persistence-unit />` XML element. The `name` attribute is 
required and is used to identify the persistent unit. The `transaction-type=”JTA”` element specifies 
to use Java Transaction API (JTA) transactions. In a Java EE environment, the default is JTA if this 
element is not specified.

The `eclipselink.ddl-generation` properties are used here to avoid having to manually create a database 
table to run this sample application. To learn more about the `ddl-generation` properties, see the 
http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/p_ddl_generation.htm[JPA Extensions Reference for EclipseLink.]

The `eclipselink.logging.level` properties are used to specify the EclipseLink logging levels 
that are displayed in the WAS server log. To learn more, see the http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/p_logging_level.htm[
JPA Extensions Reference for EclipseLink.]

A JTA transaction type requires a data source to be provided. This is done through the 
`eventjpadatasource` element which specifies the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name of 
the data source that is to be used by the EJB container. This means that a Java Database Connectivity 
(JDBC) connection does not have to be specified in the `persistence.xml` file and instead the data 
source can be preconfigured in the `server.xml`.

Configure the data source in the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file:

[source, Xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=**;]
----

The `derbyJDBCLib` element is a shared library that points to the directory of the JDBC driver. The 
JDBC driver is what enables the application to interact with the database.

The data source configuration is done within the `<dataSource />` element. The `<properties.derby.embedded />` 
attribute within the data source configuration contains embedded derby properties such as the database name 
and whether to create the database if it does not already exist.

// =================================================================================================

== Performing CRUD operations using JPA

CRUD is an abbreviation that defines the four basic functionalities that can be performed on a 
database: create, read, update and delete.

To perform CRUD operations using JPA, create the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/dao/EventDao.java` 
file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/dao/EventDao.java[tags=!copyright;]
----

In order to use the `EntityManager` at runtime, it must be injected into our EJB component through the
`@PersistenceContext` annotation. Since the `EntityManager` is container-managed, the EJB container
will ensure that the methods are executed within an active transaction which is why it is not necessary
to explicitly begin, commit or rollback transactions. At the end of an EJB oeration, the persistence 
context will be notified that the transaction is committing and the persistence provider, EclipseLink,
will flush the changes to the database.

The `EventDao.java` class has a method for each CRUD operation, so let's break them down:

* The `createEvent()` method persists an instance of the `Event` entity class to the datastore by
calling the `persist()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. The argument passed into the `persist()`
method must be an instance of an entity class, otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.  

* The `readEvent()` method will return an instance of the `Event` entity class with the specified primary 
key by calling the `find()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. The `find()` method accepts both the entity 
class and the primary key as arguments. If the event instance is not found, Null will be returned. Similarily,
the `readAllEvents()` method returns a list of instances of the `Event` entity class using a query
specified in the `@NamedQuery` annotation on the `Event` class. 

* The `updateEvent()` method updates an instance of the `Event` entity class in the database. The 
`EntityManager` automatically tracks entity objects in the persistence context for changes and synchronizes
them with the database. The `merge()` method will copy the entity supplied as an argument into a new 
`Event` instance that will be added to the persistence context so that its changes can be tracked.

* The `deleteEvent()` method removes an instance of the `Event` entity class from the database by 
calling the `remove()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. An instance of an entity class must
be passed as an argument to the `remove()` method, otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` will be
thrown.

When the server is running, visit the {eventapp-url} URL to view the Event Manager application. 

Using the `Create event` button in the left navigation bar you are able to create events that will 
be persisted to the database. Once you have created an event, it will be available to view, update 
and delete in the `Event list` section.

== Testing the application

Create the `EventEntityTest` test class in the `finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/tests/EventEntityTest.java` 
file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/tests/EventEntityTest.java[tags=!copyright;]
----

The `testCRUD` method creates a test event and persists it to the database. The event object is then 
retrieved from the database to verify that the test event was actually persisted. Next, the test event's 
name, location and time is updated. The event object is retrieved from the database to verify that 
the updated event is stored. Finally, the updated test event is deleted and one final check is done 
to ensure the updated test event is no longer stored in the database.
